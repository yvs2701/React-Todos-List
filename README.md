# `Todos-List`
This is my first react project, I took days to understand react and I'm still leaning :)
Hope you like this react app!

## The basic layout:

You will get to see three todos already in the list they are simply there to help describe the UI and the project as a whole.

## Add your Todos:

You can add your todos by simply filling the title and desciption (optional) of your todo and press the add button

## Wipe out the completed tasks !

Simply click the trash button, to delete a completed task

## Opening a decription for any todo hides the description for other tasks :)
